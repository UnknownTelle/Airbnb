# Airbnb Dashbored
## The Project
With this university project the goal was to make an application about Airbnb data for members of the public and staff to use. The application uses a formatted dataset from New York City specifically for the coursework. The user can use this application to search, display, edit and add new district and neighbourhood. The user can also search, display and add new property.
